# SimpleModbusCommander
Simple c# Modbus RU RS485 library &amp; sample programs for reading data out of Epever Solar charge controllers and Huawei ESM Lifep04 48v batteries.  

This project is mainly for a proof of concept / example.   
I make no claims as to it's accuracy or reliability.
At time of writing other .Net Modbus libraries were a bit complex for my liking.  
Also there was little / no information avaiable on the web for communicating with a Huawei ESM Lifep04 battery / BMS.
Epever has freely downloadable GUI's for interacting with it's Charge controlers, however I wanted something more customizable and with better live charts. (Thanks ScottPlot!)

-SimpleModbusCommander: Simple Modbus library, focusing on simple, suscinct code
-ModBusLogger_EpeverUI: Sample UI w/live charts for Epever Charge controller monitoring
-ModBusLogger_HuaweiUI: Sample UI w/live charts for Huawei ESM Battery monitoring  - Note: not reliable :)
-ModBusLogger_Console: Simple console app for monitoring
